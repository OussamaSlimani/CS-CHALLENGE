# Server

This directory contains the core server infrastructure of the SMARTSHIELD platform, essential for both user interface management and secure authentication. The server component is organized into two primary sections:

1. **User Interface and Login**:  
   This section handles the platformâ€™s front-end interface, allowing users to access SMARTSHIELD through a streamlined login process that includes SMS verification for secure authentication. This verification layer ensures that only authorized users can enter the platform.

2. **Dashboard and Incident Response**:  
   After successful login, users are directed to an interactive dashboard, where they can view comprehensive information on collected security data, real-time predictions from AI models, and automated incident responses. This dashboard centralizes all relevant data, making it accessible and actionable, with insights derived from the data gathered by the SMARTSHIELD agent and analyzed by integrated ML models.

The server is designed to provide users with a seamless, secure experience, centralizing all critical information necessary for real-time cybersecurity monitoring and incident response.
